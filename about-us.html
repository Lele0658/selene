        <h2>Role:</h2>
        <p>As the goddess of the moon, Selene was often depicted driving her moon chariot across the heavens. Unlike her brother Helios' golden sun chariot, Selene's chariot was silver, drawn by two snow-white horses. This imagery symbolized the cool, reflective light of the moon as opposed to the bright, direct light of the sun.

            Selene's connection with Artemis and Hecate, other lunar goddesses, further emphasized her lunar attributes. While Artemis represented the crescent or waxing moon and Hecate the waning moon, Selene was often considered the full moon, embodying the moon's complete illumination and its effects on the earth.</p>
