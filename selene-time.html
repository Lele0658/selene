        <h2>Selene: How She Impacted Time</h2>
        <p>Selene, the Greek goddess of the moon, played a significant role in ancient Greek culture and mythology. Her influence extended beyond mere lunar representation; she was intricately linked to the passage of time. The ancient Greeks measured time by the phases of the moon, and Selene's cycles were essential for agricultural and religious calendars.</p>
        <p>Her association with time is evident in various myths and stories, where she is depicted as a celestial figure guiding the night sky. The lunar calendar, which was based on Selene's cycles, was crucial for determining festivals, planting seasons, and other important events in ancient Greek society.</p>
        <p>Selene's impact on time is also reflected in her relationships with other deities. For instance, her connection with Helios, the sun god, symbolizes the duality of day and night, further emphasizing the importance of celestial bodies in marking the passage of time.</p>
        <p>One of the names given for Selene, and occasionally for an independent personification, was Mene. The Greek word for the moon was also the word used to delineate the months.

            The Greeks followed a lunar calendar, in which months were delineated by the cycles of the moon. Greek months began with the first new moon and were organized into three ten-day weeks that roughly followed the progression of the lunar cycle.
            
            Festivals and feasts were determined by the lunar calendar, giving Selene as Mene an important role in the worship of all the gods and goddesses.
            
            As the goddess of the division of the months, Selene was a goddess of time. She was often said to be the mother of the Horai, the personifications of the division of time and the seasons.
            
            The months had their own personifications as well, who were all born from Selene. These were the fifty daughters who were fathered by Endymion â€“ the fifty months represented the four-year cycle of the Olympiads.</p>
